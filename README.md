# graph-theory-project
This is a Python 3 program that searches a text file using a regualr expression. The user is prompted for the text file directory location, followed by the text file name and lastly, the expression they are searching for. The line number and lines that have the expression in them are then output to the user.

## Description of Repository
The repository includes a .gitignore file, a README file, a text file containing “The adventures of Sherlock Holmes” taken from https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661.txt, an image folder containing the images of the output of the program, and lastly, the three python files needed to run the program, “main.py”, “shunting.py” and “thompson.py”.

## Instructions
1. Python 3 must be installed
2. Download or clone the git repository to your local machine
   * git clone https://github.com/BrianWaldron97/graph-theory-project.git
3. Once cloned, navigate into the graph-theory-project folder
   * cd graph-theory-project
4. Inside the folder you can now run the “main.py” file to start the program
   * python main.py
5. Once the program starts, you will be prompted to enter the directory path
6. You will then be asked to enter the full name of the text file
7. You will then be prompted to enter an expression
8. If the expression was found, the number of them found will be displayed along with the line they were found in and the full lines they were in also
